    <h1>Local Accountability Framework</h1>

    <h2 id="p2-overview">Phase 2: Designing the Vision: Crafting the Architecture of a Local Accountability System</h2>
    <h3>Big Idea</h3>

    <div class="tags">
      <div>Six Pillars</div>
      <div>Local Accountability Continuum</div>
      <div>DDIER Cycle</div>
      <div>Local Accountability Principles</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Phase 2 exists because vision without architecture always collapses under pressure. Most accountability redesigns fail at this stage, not because leaders lack commitment or clarity of values, but because they underestimate how powerfully system design shapes adult behavior.
      When architecture is vague, misaligned, or incomplete, accountability defaults to what it has always been: compliance, comparison, and control, regardless of the language used to describe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phase 1 establishes purpose and community ownership. Phase 2 determines whether that purpose can survive contact with reality. This phase is not about adding more measures, dashboards, or processes. It is about intentionally designing how responsibility, evidence, decision-making, and transparency interact so the system reinforces learning rather than distorting it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phase 2 outcome in one sentence: A coherent, defensible accountability architecture that translates belief into behavior, protects learning under pressure, and earns the right to develop and pilot next-generation evidence in Phase 3.
    </p>

    <h4>Design (DDIER) in Phase 2</h4>
    <p>
      Phase 2 remains anchored in the Design stage of DDIER, but the work shifts from defining success to designing the system mechanics that will carry that definition. This is design as in system design: making claims explicit, mapping evidence, setting decision rules, and building coherence across pillars, routines, and reporting.
    </p>
    <p><strong>DDIER: Design</strong></p>

    <h4>Primary Pillars in Phase 2</h4>
    <p>
      Phase 2 activates all pillars, with strongest emphasis on Pillar 1 (Purpose and Theory of Action), Pillar 2 (Governance and Leadership), Pillar 4 (Data Validation and Utilization), and Pillar 6 (Reporting and Transparency). If governance, validation, or transparency are weak here, the system drifts into compliance even when the vision is strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pillar 1:</strong> Purpose and Theory of Action
      <strong>Pillar 2:</strong> Governance and Leadership
      <strong>Pillar 3:</strong> Community Engagement and Advocacy
      <strong>Pillar 4:</strong> Data Validation and Utilization
      <strong>Pillar 5:</strong> Evaluating Progress and Impact
      <strong>Pillar 6:</strong> Reporting and Transparency
    </p>

    <h4>Continuum Focus in Phase 2</h4>
    <p>
      Phase 2 sits in the middle moves of the Continuum. It bridges defining success and designing learning into an operational architecture that can gather, interpret, and use evidence consistently across classrooms, schools, and the district. This is where the system designs how it will demonstrate student success without collapsing the story into a single number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Continuum:</strong> Define Success for Students
      <strong>Continuum:</strong> Design Vibrant Learning Experiences for Students
      <strong>Continuum:</strong> Demonstrate Student Success
    </p>

    <h4>Local Accountability Principles Activated in Phase 2</h4>
    <p>
      These principles are constraints, not slogans. They prevent predictable failure modes such as compliance theater, proxy collapse, and reporting disconnected from learning. In Phase 2, leaders should name which principles they are protecting, how the architecture protects them, and what the system will do when pressure pushes against them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Student-Centered by Design:</strong> prevents adult convenience from becoming the hidden objective.</li>
      <li><strong>Locally Defined, Publicly Transparent:</strong> prevents insider-only accountability and public confusion.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Measures, One Coherent Story:</strong> prevents fragmentation and metric overload.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Improvement Over Episodic Judgment:</strong> prevents retrospective, punitive cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>Reciprocal Responsibility:</strong> prevents accountability from flowing only downward.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity Over Complexity:</strong> prevents sophistication from masking incoherence.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Leader reality:</strong> Phase 2 is where districts either design a system that protects learning, or unintentionally design a system that protects compliance.
    </div>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <h3 id="p2-steps">Phase 2 Steps. What Leaders Actually Do</h3>
    <p>
      Phase 2 works when it is treated like disciplined system design, not a document-writing project. The goal is not to produce a perfect framework. The goal is to build an architecture that can be explained, defended, and used consistently under real conditions.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 1: Translate Vision into Claims and Decisions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Convert the Portrait of a Learner and Growth-Mastery-Readiness definitions into explicit claims the system will make about learning.</li>
      <li>List the decisions those claims must support (instructional adjustments, supports, reporting, governance).</li>
      <li>Separate decisions appropriate for local evidence from decisions that still require state or federal measures.</li>
      <li>Write plain-language decision rules so evidence is not misused under pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pillar 1:</strong> Purpose and Theory of Action <strong>DDIER:</strong> Design <strong>Principle:</strong> Clarity Over Complexity</p>

    <h4>Step 2: Design the Evidence Logic (Evidence Map 2.0)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Define what counts as evidence for each claim, including student work, performance tasks, portfolios, and relevant academic indicators.</li>
      <li>Specify minimum quality requirements (rubrics, calibration, interpretability, fairness checks).</li>
      <li>Flag evidence that is high-stakes, low-quality, or likely to be misused (proxy collapse).</li>
      <li>Design for growth over time, not snapshots.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pillar 4:</strong> Data Validation and Utilization <strong>Principle:</strong> Multiple Measures <strong>Principle:</strong> Evidence Quality</p>

    <h4>Step 3: Align the Six Pillars as Load-Bearing Supports</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Assign operational roles to each pillar so the system cannot function with missing pieces.</li>
      <li>Define pillar dependencies (reporting depends on validation, evaluation depends on theory of action, governance protects integrity).</li>
      <li>Write “misalignment warnings” that describe what drift looks like when a pillar is weak.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pillars:</strong> 1-6 <strong>Principle:</strong> Systemic Coherence</p>

    <h4>Step 4: Build the Continuum Flow</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design how the system moves from defining success to demonstrating impact publicly.</li>
      <li>Prevent shortcuts (reporting without meaning, evidence without interpretation, response without coherence).</li>
      <li>Define cadence and routines for evidence review, interpretation, and improvement action.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Continuum:</strong> Define Success -> Demonstrate Student Success <strong>Principle:</strong> Transparency and Interpretability</p>

    <h4>Step 5: Embed DDIER as Discipline, Not a Checklist</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify what belongs in Design now versus what belongs in Development and Implementation later.</li>
      <li>Define what Evaluation will study (coherence, validity, workload, interpretability, equity signals).</li>
      <li>Set a revision rule. Revise based on evidence and learning, not politics or convenience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>DDIER:</strong> Design -> Development readiness <strong>Principle:</strong> Continuous Improvement</p>

    <h4>Step 6: Roles, Authority, and Non-Delegables</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify what district leaders cannot delegate (coherence, governance rules, evidence protections).</li>
      <li>Define what school leaders own (interpretation and support cycles) versus what teachers own (task design and evidence curation).</li>
      <li>Ensure the board and community have stewardship roles that build trust rather than micromanage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pillar 2:</strong> Governance and Leadership <strong>Pillar 3:</strong> Community Engagement and Advocacy <strong>Principle:</strong> Reciprocal Responsibility</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Leader reality check:</strong> If Phase 2 ends with architecture that cannot be explained, defended, and used, Phase 3 becomes professional learning designed to compensate for design flaws.
    </div>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Architecture -->
    <h3 id="p2-architecture">Designing the Accountability Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      Phase 2 aligns four structural elements that must function together: the Six Pillars, the Local Accountability Continuum, the DDIER Cycle, and the Local Accountability Principles. These are interlocking safeguards that prevent drift into compliance.
    </p>

    <h4>The Six Pillars as Structural Safeguards</h4>
    <p>
      Each pillar prevents a known system failure. When one pillar is weak, pressure transfers to the others. Eventually, the system compensates by reverting to compliance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pillar 1: Purpose and Theory of Action</strong> prevents activity without intention and reform without logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Pillar 2: Governance and Leadership</strong> prevents responsibility drift and decision-making ambiguity.</li>
      <li><strong>Pillar 3: Community Engagement and Advocacy</strong> prevents accountability from becoming insider-only.</li>
      <li><strong>Pillar 4: Data Validation and Utilization</strong> prevents low-quality data from driving high-stakes decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Pillar 5: Evaluating Progress and Impact</strong> prevents snapshot judgments and reactionary leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Pillar 6: Reporting and Transparency</strong> prevents misinterpretation, mistrust, and narrative vacuum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Local Accountability Continuum as System Flow</h4>
    <p>
      The continuum defines how learning becomes visible. Phase 2 explicitly designs for continuity across stages so the district does not skip meaning and jump straight to reporting.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define success with the community</li>
      <li>Design learning aligned to that success</li>
      <li>Gather meaningful evidence</li>
      <li>Interpret evidence collaboratively</li>
      <li>Respond through support and adjustment</li>
      <li>Demonstrate impact publicly</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>What happens when the continuum is broken:</strong>
      Reporting without shared definition breeds confusion. Evidence without interpretation invites misjudgment. Response without clarity creates initiative churn.
    </div>

    <h4>The DDIER Cycle as Operating Discipline</h4>
    <p>
      Phase 2 embeds DDIER as a learning engine, not a procedural checklist. The district protects design integrity so Implementation does not become compliance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design:</strong> clarify claims, evidence requirements, and decision rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Develop:</strong> build tools and routines that match design (rubrics, calibration, reporting templates).</li>
      <li><strong>Implement:</strong> pilot with real work and real constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> study coherence, validity, workload, interpretability, equity, and unintended consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Revise:</strong> adjust based on evidence and learning, not politics or convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Evidence & Practice -->
    <h3 id="p2-evidence">Designing Evidence With Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      Evidence design is not neutral. Phase 2 makes explicit decisions about what counts as evidence, whose learning is made visible, and which questions the system is willing to ask itself. Authentic evidence creates discomfort. Systems often protect adults from that discomfort by narrowing evidence or delaying its use. Phase 2 rejects that avoidance.
    </p>

    <h4>Evidence Commitments</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence must emerge from meaningful learning experiences.</li>
      <li>Evidence must show growth over time, not just snapshots.</li>
      <li>Evidence must include student work and performance, not only scores.</li>
      <li>Evidence must inform action, not just reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Evidence Misuse Traps to Design Against</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Convenience bias:</strong> choosing what is easiest to collect instead of what is most meaningful.</li>
      <li><strong>Proxy collapse:</strong> using a single number as a stand-in for readiness.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance theater:</strong> collecting artifacts to satisfy a requirement instead of documenting learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Delayed learning:</strong> waiting until end-of-year results to decide what students needed all along.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Design protection:</strong>
      If the system cannot validate evidence quality, it cannot ethically increase the stakes attached to that evidence.
    </div>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Stakeholder Roles -->
    <h3 id="p2-roles">Stakeholder Roles. Reciprocal Accountability in Phase 2</h3>
    <p>
      Phase 2 clarifies what accountability requires of each level. When responsibility is unclear, it defaults downward. Reciprocal accountability prevents that slide.
    </p>

    <h4>Students</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate learning through authentic work and reflection.</li>
      <li>Curate evidence that shows growth, mastery, and readiness over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Teachers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design learning that naturally produces meaningful evidence.</li>
      <li>Use common language and rubrics so evidence is interpretable and improvable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>School Leaders</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead evidence interpretation and support cycles, not just compliance checks.</li>
      <li>Protect coherence by resisting initiative overload and evidence misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>District Leaders</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Own system coherence, evidence quality protections, and decision rules.</li>
      <li>Ensure equity of access to strong learning experiences and credible evidence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Board and Community</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide stewardship. Keep the system honest, understandable, and aligned to local values.</li>
      <li>Use information to support improvement, not to perform public judgment.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Why this matters:</strong>
      If Phase 2 does not make roles and decision rules explicit, accountability becomes something done to schools instead of something built with the community.
    </div>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Key Outcome -->
    <h3 id="p2-outcome">Phase 2: Key Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      By the end of Phase 2, the district should have more than a vision statement. It should have a small set of concrete products that anchor local accountability and create a strong runway into Phase 3. These outcomes make it possible to build coherent tools, instead of bolting accountability onto existing work.
    </p>

    <h4>1) A Defensible Accountability Architecture</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear system claims about student success and what evidence supports each claim.</li>
      <li>Decision rules that prevent misuse and proxy collapse.</li>
      <li>Explicit alignment between the Six Pillars, Continuum, DDIER, and Principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2) Evidence Requirements and Quality Protections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimum standards for rubrics, calibration, interpretability, and fairness checks.</li>
      <li>Clear guidance on what evidence can and cannot be used for high-stakes decisions.</li>
      <li>A plan to improve evidence quality over time instead of blaming people for weak tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3) Roles, Authority, and Cadence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear ownership of evidence interpretation and improvement cycles.</li>
      <li>Explicit governance routines and feedback loops (including how community input changes design).</li>
      <li>A review cadence that supports learning in real time, not retrospective judgment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4) Readiness for Phase 3 Development</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A prioritized build list tied directly to architecture needs (not a wishlist).</li>
      <li>Defined pilot logic: where to start, what to collect, and how expansion decisions will be made.</li>
      <li>Agreement on what “done” looks like before scaling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>What “ready” really means:</strong>
      Ready does not mean finished. Ready means the district can explain its architecture, defend its evidence claims, and operate improvement cycles without confusion.
    </p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <!-- Practice in Action -->
    <h3 id="p2-practice">Practice in Action: Phase 2 in Fleming County Schools</h3>
    <p>
      In Fleming County Schools, Phase 2 is where the district protects coherence across Measures of Quality, the Portrait of a Learner, BRIDGE Performance Indicators, Next-Generation Readiness Assessments, and BPI Websites. The goal is not to add another layer. The goal is to design an architecture where evidence and decisions stay aligned to what the community values.
    </p>

    <h4>Architecture Choices that Protect Learning</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Dashboards and reports come after outcomes and evidence claims are clear, not before.</li>
      <li>Evidence quality is treated as improvable. Weak evidence triggers better tasks and calibration, not blame.</li>
      <li>Growth, mastery, and readiness are reported as a balanced story to avoid collapsing success into a single number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Field insight</h4>
    <p>
      When Phase 2 is done well, the system feels lighter because it is clearer. When Phase 2 is rushed, the system feels heavier because people do not trust what it is asking them to do.
